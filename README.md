## Hello, World! 👋

### About me 😄
Since early 2020, I am your typical lazy Canadian programmer that flies under the radar. I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and creating projects for fun in my spare time. I also enjoy sleeping way too much.

### What I do 🤔
I regularly code with Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Processing. These languages are what I feel most comfortable with, and I am constantly working to improve my skills and abilities with them. And if you are interested in knowing what editor I use to code, it is VSCode.

###  Fun fact 😎
It might be the most boring profile you've ever seen today or even this week, but you will possibly never forget the moment that you read this sentence without ever realizing it.
