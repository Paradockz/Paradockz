## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

### About me ðŸ˜„
Since early 2020, I am your typical lazy Canadian programmer who flies under the radar. I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and creating projects for fun in my spare time. I also enjoy sleeping way too much.

### What I do ðŸ¤”
I regularly code with Javascript, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Processing. These languages are what I feel most comfortable with, and I am constantly working to improve my skills and abilities with them. And if you are interested in what editor I use to code, it is Visual Studio Code.
